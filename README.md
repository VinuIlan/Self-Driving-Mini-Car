Self-Driving-Mini-Car
=====================

Arduino code for self driving mini car written for ECE110

In my ECE110 class, we had to make a mini car follow a given path using light sensors to read the ground.
I wrote the Arduino code to take the inputs and based on what values were read, sent the car straight, left or right.
